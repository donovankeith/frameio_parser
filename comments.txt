00:00:03:05 - Audio on one side only?

	Patrick Goski - 11:27AM January 26th, 2016
	It's some issue with Camtasia and my mic. for the final video I pull the audio out and create a proper mono track.

001 - Rick Barrett - 11:04AM January 26th, 2016
00:16:15:15 -   Really good. I don't see any issues. You're kinda good at this - you should do it more often :)

	Donovan Keith - 2:39PM January 27th, 2016
	Agreed!

00:00:31:00 - It's not completely clear at this point how what we're going to do differs from sculpting displacement. I don't think it needs a re-record, but maybe we could pop up a callout "We'll be using the sculpting tools to directly manipulate the polygons and points. Use the Sculpt tag if you plan to bake displacement" (is that right?)

	Patrick Goski - 11:30AM January 28th, 2016
	Haha, yeah. This I realized to late, because I was really keen on showing working with polygons and how fluid it can be.

	Patrick Goski - 11:31AM January 28th, 2016
	I had considered doing a video where I show using the unsubdivide command to take all the work we did and dump it into a sculpt tag. :D

	Patrick Goski - 11:52AM January 28th, 2016
	It kind of sucks, because I know the best workflow is just go sculpt tag, but I like all the little tidbits that arise, and troubleshooting.

001 - Rick Barrett - 11:25AM January 28th, 2016
00:03:33:06 -  Didn't realize that you could sculpt in model mode (without a sculpt tag) #protip

002 - Rick Barrett - 11:29AM January 28th, 2016
00:05:22:04 - You say bring in here, but don't explain how that works. Add a callout something like "To invert a brush (sculpt inward), hold the control key)"

003 - Rick Barrett - 11:31AM January 28th, 2016
00:05:33:06 - Might be too tight with the previous (more important) callout, but it would be nice to reinforce with a callout "Temporary Smooth Mode: Shift"

	Patrick Goski - 11:32AM January 28th, 2016
	I was thinking this too. I try to callout the modifiers as I use them...but trying to maintain speed and calling everything out is tough.

004 - Rick Barrett - 11:35AM January 28th, 2016
00:08:08:22 - Might be worth a callout here to remind people that MMB drag adjusts the size of the brush.

005 - Rick Barrett - 11:36AM January 28th, 2016
00:08:36:13 - Might be a good point for a cut - since you've done the initial sculpt and you're returning to some modeling tasks

006 - Rick Barrett - 11:40AM January 28th, 2016
00:08:55:23 - or here

007 - Rick Barrett - 11:56AM January 28th, 2016
00:13:12:14 - Cut here?

008 - Rick Barrett - 12:03PM January 28th, 2016
00:23:23:12 - Didn't we add a mirror option in one of the latest releases? Does that only work with the Sculpt tag?

009 - Rick Barrett - 12:04PM January 28th, 2016
00:23:43:20 - This is a good cut point - maybe skip the Ears cut I listed earlier

010 - Rick Barrett - 12:06PM January 28th, 2016
00:23:30:20 - No optimize?

011 - Rick Barrett - 12:08PM January 28th, 2016
00:26:37:05 - It doesn't matter that the last selection was sloppy? Also - might be nice to add a brief description of UV Terrace in a callout - I have no idea what it does.

012 - Rick Barrett - 12:12PM January 28th, 2016
00:29:44:22 - Cut here

013 - Rick Barrett - 12:23PM January 28th, 2016
00:36:12:17 - Looks really good. I marked a few spots that I think would be good places to split this into a few parts so it's a bit more manageable. Other than that and a few callouts I think it's good.

014 - Patrick Goski - 12:42PM February 16th, 2016
00:00:26:04 - INFO: In this project all sculpting will happen directly on the polygon mesh. You could also use a sculpt tag to achieve similar and then export the top level when you finish.

015 - Patrick Goski - 1:04PM February 16th, 2016
00:04:25:11 - CALLOUT: Reverse Brush Direction | CTRL + LMB

016 - Patrick Goski - 1:09PM February 16th, 2016
00:05:41:02 - CALLOUT: Smooth Brush Modifier | Hold SHIFT While Clicking

017 - Patrick Goski - 1:11PM February 16th, 2016
00:07:50:13 - CALLOUT: Adjust Brush Radius | MMB Drag Left and Right

018 - Patrick Goski - 1:13PM February 16th, 2016
00:09:16:22 - INFO: While the following method is good, the one shortcoming is that we will need to rebuild the UV map. If you were using the sculpt tag you could focus your effort on one side and then use the Sculpt Symmetry tools.

019 - Patrick Goski - 1:15PM February 16th, 2016
00:10:13:04 - CALLOUT: Fill Selection | U~F

020 - Patrick Goski - 1:17PM February 16th, 2016
00:11:38:11 - CALLOUT: Select Loop | Double Click an edge

021 - Patrick Goski - 1:38PM February 16th, 2016
00:23:15:18 - INFO: While this doesn't take to much effort to perform, this action could have been avoided if the sculpt tag was used. As you could utilize the "Sculpt Symmetry" function.

022 - Patrick Goski - 1:41PM February 16th, 2016
00:23:35:15 - INFO: You may also want to run "Optimize" set to "Unused Points" but it is not important at this point.

023 - Patrick Goski - 1:46PM February 16th, 2016
00:26:19:02 - INFO: This selection does not need to be incredibly exact, as the function will only work on points on an open edge.

024 - Patrick Goski - 1:47PM February 16th, 2016
00:27:17:20 - INFO: The face or Torso may not be perfectly aligned for you, if this is the case continue watching as that case will be covered later.

025 - Patrick Goski - 1:58PM February 16th, 2016
00:35:47:14 - INFO: Obviously, much more time can be spent on refining the details for the model, and I definitely recommend taking more time to practice on your own. Sculpting is an art form, and takes practice.
